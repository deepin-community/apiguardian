Description: Level of stability annotation for frameworks or applications
 API Guardian provides the @API annotation that is used to annotate public
 types, methods, constructors, and fields within a framework or application
 in order to publish their status and level of stability and to indicate
 how they are intended to be used by consumers of the API.
